## Problem
Fashion-oriented people are sensitive to what they wear because they use fashion as a form of self-expression. Backpack is universal accessory that elevates fashion style, but it is hard to match your backpack with many other different styles of fashion.

## Solution
Omnibag is a smart backpack that can customize with changing colors, patterns, and pre- made designs by its connection to a smartphone or smartwatch. Omnibag is designed with innovative technology for people who want to be more expressive as an universal accessory. One essential feature is that Omnibag reacts depends on your geolocation for functional use. Omnibag is truly an irreplaceable and sustainable product that will replace more than hundreds of bags.

## Needs
Installing RGB LED to breadboard and show various color changes through smart phone would be prototype for Omnibag.
